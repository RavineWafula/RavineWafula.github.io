									<p>Git is a free and open source distributed code management and version control system that is used for
                                    tracking changes in any set of files for the purpose of coordinating work among programmers collaboratively
                                     developing source code during software development.</p>
                                     <p>Github is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers that provides
                                        internet hosting and version control using Git.</p>

									<h3 class="major">MICROCONTROLLER vs MICROCOMPUTER</h3>
									<p>A <strong>microcontroller</strong> is a small computer on a single metal-oxide semiconductor integrated circuit chip
                                         that contains one or more processor cores along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals.
                                          They are usually designed for embedded systems. A microcontroller has more number of registers making
                                        it easier to write programs.</p>
                                    <p>A <strong>microcomputer</strong> is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central
                                         processing unit. It includes a microprocessor, memory and minimal input/output circuitry mounted on a
                                          single printed circuit board (PCB). A microcomputer has less number of registers making most of the 
                                          operations memory based. It is mainly used in personal computers.</p>

									<h3 class="major">TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)</h3>
                                        <p><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong> works by adding an additional layer of security to your online accounts.
											 It requires an additional login credential beyond just username and password to gain access and 
											 getting that second credential requires access to something that belongs to you.</p>
										<p>Companies and organizations that use two factor authentication include Amazon, Apple, Dashline, Dropbox, Facebook, 
											Google, Linkdin, Microsoft, Instagram, Paypal, Reddit, Slack, Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, Yahoo.</p>
										<p><strong>The types of 2FA include: </strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li><p><strong>2FA via SMS.</strong> A sectrt one-time passcode is sent to users mobile number as an SMS text message to verify 
												their identity after they successfullly entered their username and password.</p>
											</li>
											<li><p><strong>2FA via Phone Call.</strong> Users get verification code via a phone call after they enter the correct 
												username and password.</p>
											</li>
											<li><p><strong>2FA via email.</strong> Here, the one-time passcode is sent via email for the user to claim their identity. Sometimes, 
												instead of a passcode, simply clicking a unique lind in the email also grants access to the accounts.</p>
											</li>
											<li><p><strong>2FA via Software. </strong>In this method, users have to install an application on their computer or smartphone 
												to get 2FA code. This software dynamically generates tokens for the user that last a brief period of time. So by this method
												 after successful login, users simply have to open this app and type in on screen current 2FA token to gain access to their account.</p>
											</li>
											<li><p><strong>2FA via Hardware. </strong>Here, a 2FA token is generated with the help of a hardware device; key fob or dongle. This 
												hardware generally comes with LCD screen and at every 30 to 60 seconds, a new code is displayed on the screen.</p>
											</li>
											<li><p><strong>2FA via Biometric. </strong>In biometric verification, the actual user becomes the token. Ones fingerprint, retina, voice
												 or facial recognition acts as the 2FA token to claim their identity to get access to their account.</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
										<h2 class="major">IoT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS</h2>
										<p>Some of the major IoT technology and protocols used in the internet of things include Bluetooth, Wifi, Radio Protocols, LTE-A,
											 and WiFi-Direct</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												<strong>Bluetooth</strong>
												<p>It is an important short-range IoT communications Protocol which has become very important in
													 computing and many consumer product markets. It is expected to be key for wearable products 
													in particular. The new Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) or Bluetooth Smart - as it is now branded 
													- is a significantly reduced power consumption.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Zigbee</strong>
												<p>IZigbee is similar to Bluetooth and is majorly used in industrial settings. It has some significant
													 advantages in complex systems offering low-power operation, high security, robustness and
													  high and is well positioned to take advantage of wireless control and sensor networks in
													   IoT applications.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Z-Wave</strong>
												<p>Z-Wave is a low-power RF communications IoT technology that primarily design for home automation
													 for products such as lamp controllers and sensors among other devices. A Z-Wave uses a simpler
													  protocol than some others, which can enable faster and simpler development, but the only 
													  maker of chips is Sigma Designs compared to multiple sources for other wireless technologies
													   such as Zigbee and others.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Wi-Fi</strong>
												<p>WiFi connectivity is one of the most popular IoT communication protocol, ofter an obvious 
													choice for many developers, especially given the availability of WiFi within the home
													 environment within LANs. There is a wide existing infrastructure as well as offering fast
													  data transfer and the ability to handle high quantities of data. Currently, the most
													   common WiFi standard used in homes and many businesses is 802.11n, which offers range 
													   of hundreds of megabit per second, which is fine for file transfers but may be too 
													   power-consuming for many IoT application.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Cellular</strong>
												<p>Any IoT application that requires operation over longer distances can take advantage of 
													GSM/3G/4G cellular communication capabilities. While cellular is clearly capable of sending
													 high quantities of data, especially for 4G, the cost and also power consumption will be 
													 too high for many applications. But it can be ideal for sensor-based low-bandwidth-data 
													 projects that will send very low amounts of data over the Internet.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Near Field Communication (NFC)</strong>
												<p>NFC is an IoT technology which enables simple and safe communications between electronic
													 devices, and specifically for smartphones, allowing consumers to perform transactions 
													 in which one does not have to be physically present. It helps the user to access digital 
													 content and connect electronic devices. Essentially it extends the capability of 
													 contactless card technology and enables devices to share information at a distance 
													 that is less than 4cm.</p>
											</li>
										</ol>
										<h2 class="major">OSI MODEL (OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION</h2>
										<p>OSI is a reference model for how applications communicate over a network. This model focuses on 
											providing a visual design of how each communications layer is built on top of the other, 
											starting with the physical cabling, all the way to the application that’s trying to 
											communicate with other devices on a network.</p>
										<p>A reference model is a conceptual framework for understanding relationships. The purpose of the
											 OSI reference model is to guide technology vendors and developers so the digital communications 
											 products and software programs they create can interoperate and to promote a clear framework 
											 that describes the functions of a networking or telecommunications system that’s in use.</p>
										<p>The main concept of OSI is that the process of communication between two endpoints in a network 
											can be divided into seven distinct groups of related functions, or laters. Each communicating
											 user or program is on a device that can provide those seven layers of function.</p>
										<p>In this architecture, each layer serves the layer above it and, in turn, is served by the 
											layers below it. So, in a given message between users, there will be a flow of data down 
											through the layers in the source computer, across the network  and then up through the layers
											 in the receiving computer. Only the application layer at the top of the stack doesn’t provide
											  services to a higher-level layer.</p>
										<p>The seven layers of function are provided by a combination of applications, operating systems, 
											network card device drivers, networking hardware and protocols that enable a system to transmit
											 a signal over a network through various physical mediums, including twisted-pair copper, 
											 fiber optics, Wi-Fi or Long-Term Evolution (LTE) with 5G.</p>
										<h2 class="major">THE 7 LAYERS OF THE OSI MODEL</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>Layer 1: The Physical layer</strong>
												<p>The physical layer transports data using electrical, mechanical or procedural interfaces. 
													This layer is responsible for sending computer bits from one device to another along 
													the network. It determines how physical connections to the network are set up and how
													 bits are represented into predictable signals as they’re transmitted either electrically,
													  optically or via radio waves.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Layer 2: The Data-link layer</strong>
												<p>The data-link, or protocol layer, in a program handles moving data into and out of 
													aphysical link in a network. This layer handles problems that occur as a result of 
													bit transmission errors. It ensures that the pace of the data flow doesn’t overwhelm
													 the sending and receiving devices. This layer also permits the transmission of data
													to Layer 3, the network layer, where it’s addressed and routed.
													The data-link layer can be further divided into 2 sublayers. The higher layer, which
													 is called logical link control (LLC), is responsible for multiplexing, flow control,
													  acknowledgement and notifying upper layers if transmit/receive (TX/RX) errors occur.
													The media access control sublayer is responsible for tracking data frames using MAC 
													addresses of the sending and receiving hardware. It’s also responsible for organizing
													 each frame, marking the starting and ending bits and organizing timing regarding when
													  each frame can be sent along the physical layer medium.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Layer 3: The Network layer</strong>
												<p>The primary function of the network layer is to move data into and through other networks.
													 Network layer protocols accomplish this by packaging data with correct network address
													  information, selecting the appropriate network routes and forwarding the packaged
													   data up the stack to the transport layer. From a TCP/IP perspective, this is where
													    IP addresses are applied for routing purposes.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Layer 4: The Transport layer</strong>
												<p>The transport layer is responsible for the transferring data across a network and provides 
													error-checking mechanisms and data flow controls. It determines how much data to send, 
													where it gets sent and at what rate. TCP within the TCP/IP suite is the best-known 
													example of the transport layer. This is where the communications select TCP port numbers
													 to categorize and organize data transmissions across a network.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Layer 5: The Session layer</strong>
												<p>The session layer sets up, coordinates and terminates conversations between applications. 
													Its services include authentication and reconnection after an interruption. This layer 
													determines how long a system will wait for another application to respond. Examples of 
													session layer protocols include X.255 and Zone Information Protocol (ZIP).</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Layer 6: The Presentation layer</strong>
												<p>The presentation layer translates or formats data for the application layer based on the
													 semantics or syntax the application accepts. This layer also handles the encryption and
													  decryption that the application layer requires.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Layer 7: The Applicaton layer</strong>
												<p>The application layer enables the user - human or software - to interact with the 
													application or network whenever the user selects to read messages, transfer files or
													 perform other related tasks. Web browsers and other internet-connected apps, such as
													  Outlook and Skype, use Layer 7 application protocols.</p>
